  # The app is signed in CI with a stable release identity, so the
  # Accessibility (TCC) grant survives upgrades without local re-signing.
  # It is not notarized, so strip quarantine to keep Gatekeeper from
  # blocking it. Nothing touches the user's keychain.

  caveats <<~EOS
    If macOS asks for Accessibility permission again after upgrading from a
    locally re-signed version, re-grant it once in System Settings >
    Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
